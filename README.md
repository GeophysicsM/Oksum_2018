GCH_gravinv combines both Granser (1987) and Cordell & Henderson (1968) method
for determining the depth to the basement of a sedimentary basin derived from 
inverting of gravity anomalies.The code is designed in Matlab environment (version R2013b) 
with an easy-to-use graphical interface (GUI) allowing the user the control of input 
parameters and thereafter displaying the results of the convergence between observed 
and calculated anomalies during the ongoing process. The GUI also provides additional 
options for the visualization of the output data either in 2D maps and cross-sectional view.
